# SCBackendRequestManager Documentation Project

## Purpose
This repository is a comprehensive, community-driven project documenting the backend structure of the now-abandonware game **_Friday the 13th_**.
It aims to break down barriers created by gatekeeping within the community and make information like endpoints, packet structures, and other backend details freely accessible.

### Important Notes
1. **This is not official documentation.**
   - Everything documented here is based (so far) on my own findings, experiments, and reverse engineering **(AND ONLY APPLIES TO PSN)**.
   - This information is provided "as is" and should not be taken as an exact 1:1 representation of the original backend.
2. **Use at your own risk.**
   - The information is functional based on testing but is neither complete nor error-free.
3. **Community Focus.**
   - The purpose of this project is to share knowledge and foster collaboration, not to exploit or misuse the game.

## What’s Inside
- **Endpoints**: Documentation of backend endpoints, including request and response structures.
- **Packet Structures**: Information on game packet formats, field definitions, and examples.
